      Pet suffer from quite a lot of issues. However, there are some major
      problems that are known to cause most of the visit veterinarians get from
      pet and their owners. Skin conditions, stomach issues and ear infections
      are the major reasons dog owners visit the the vet, while urinary tract
      problem, stomach issues and of why skin condition are peculiar to cats.
      Reports shows that these problems have consistently topped the chart of
      why pet owners bring their pet to the vet. A great majority for dogs is
      skin infections like allergic dermatitis, ringworm, Tick & Flea, Mange &
      Hotspots while Stomach issues like accidential poisoning, parasitic
      infections, hormonal imbalance, allergies and ear infection are common to
      both. Dogs suffer from alot of infections but are the most prevalent
      causes of visiting the vet:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skin conditions</li>
      <li>Eye infection</li>
      <li>Ear infection</li>
      <li>Stomach issues</li>

      <li>Post-surgery check-up</li>
      <li>Cancer</li> -->
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cats, on the other hand, are mostly troubled by stomach issues which comes

      A few other reports might make some rearrangements as to how the causes
      are listed, however, the important thing is to note that these causes are
      what contributes majorly to why pets are taken to the vet.
    </p>
    <h3>Why you should take your pet to the vet</h3>
    <p>
      Most of the time, we are not ‘pushed’ to taking our pets to the vet “so
      far there’s no clear reason”. Just like you don’t find any reason to take
      your car for mechanical repair or maintenance so far its working fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, pets can’t talk, and as a result, you can only know something is
      wrong only when they start showing symptoms and most times, it’s when the
      condition is severe. Keeping up on routine visit to the vet is very
      important because your vet can easily detect or spot an underlying
      condition, which will give you and your pet a chance of treating it early
      and perhaps preventing it from ever occurring again. Pets, just like
      humans, need a regular check up to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

    <h3>2020-OGUNDAIRO SAMUEL</h3>

    <p>
      What should you do when there's an emergency? Nobody wishes for it to
      happen, however, we cannot shy away from the fact that emergencies does
      happen. So, what do you do incase of an emergency? There are different
      types of emergencies for pets. It can be poisoning, difficulty in
      breathing attack by another animal, sudden illness or being hit by a car,
      whatever the situation is, knowing what to do is very crucial in that kind
      of situation. Let take a look at few of the most common ones:
    </p>
    <p>
      Poisoning: first of all, once its noticed, determine what and how much
      your pet has ingested and seek the vet immediately. Information about what
      was taken will help the vet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accidents: accidents involving vehicle accidents with your pet can cause
      trauma. The first step is to get it out of the way and cover it with towel
      or box while heading straight to the vet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathing difficulty: if the item ingested can be seen and dislodged, do
      so. If it’s not visible, head straight to your vet immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allergies and other medical conditions are best treated with vets. If you
      are a pet-sitter, be sure to have the owner’s contact handy. They might
      know what to do and what to give it to remedy the situation incase of
      allergies.

    <h2>HOW LONG DOES POISON STAY IN A DOG'S SYSTEM</h2>

      It's widespread for pets such as cats and dogs to be exposed to hazardous
      substances in the environment. The USA, the country with the largest
      companion animal population in the world (72 million pet dogs), recorded
      over two hundred thousand cases of dog poisoning in 2019 alone. Dogs are
      notoriously curious explorers, and this makes them vulnerable to contact
      with toxic substances. Dogs could be poisoned through contact with,
      ingestion, or inhalation of hazardous materials. Typically, the amount of
      time poison stays in a dog's system depends on factors such as the type
      and amount of poison they've encountered, the treatment methods, and how
      quickly these treatments are administered. Most people assume "poison"
      refers to just chemical substances, but medication and food which are
      necessary for humans may be harmful to dogs. Ingested poisons include
      chocolate, human medicines, grapes, raisins, pesticides, poisoned rodents,
      or cleaning substances; inhaled toxins include insecticides, carbon
      monoxide and examples of contact poison are tar, paint, and arsenic.

      Ingested poisons are usually the most dangerous and account for a majority
      (95%) of all reported poison incidents. If your dog may have been
      poisoned, you should immediately take them to the vet or contact one for
      guidance. If you can't reach one, identify the poison your dog may have
      been exposed to. Most vets will advise against trying to induce your dog
      to vomit because it might make the situation worse. According to Feddes
      Jacob, a dog breeder and CEO of Fedis Kennels, you may be advised instead
      to feed your dog activated charcoal or even local palm oil to help them
      absorb the toxin. Activated charcoal is not suitable for dogs that may
      have ingested chemical substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some dog owners frequently ask if a poisoned mouse can kill a dog and the
      answer is YES. It's common for dogs to eat poisoned rats, but they may not
      begin to show symptoms immediately. Sometimes, if the dog has recently
      eaten it could take only an hour for symptoms to show but if he hasn't, it
      could be as long as 12-96 hours before he starts showing signs. Generally,
      without the proper treatment and care, some poisons such as cleaning
      agents, antifreeze, rat poison, and poisoned mice are fatal and can kill
      the dog in 2-4 days. However, with quick and accurate treatment, your dog
      could be better in 24-48 hours depending on the type of poison and
      treatment administered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your veterinarian is in the best position to examine the situation and
      give a more specific recovery time-frame based on his assessment.
