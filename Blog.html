      What should you do when there's an emergency? Nobody wishes for it to
      happen, however, we cannot shy away from the fact that emergencies does
      happen. <br/><br/>
      So, what do you do incase of an emergency? There are different
      types of emergencies for pets. It can be poisoning, difficulty in
      breathing attack by another animal, sudden illness or being hit by a car,
      whatever the situation is, knowing what to do is very crucial in that kind
      of situation. Let take a look at few of the most common ones:
      <br/><br/>
      Poisoning: first of all, once its noticed, determine what and how much
      your pet has ingested and seek the vet immediately. Information about what
      was taken will help the vet.
     <br/><br/>
      Accidents: accidents involving vehicle accidents with your pet can cause
      trauma. The first step is to get it out of the way and cover it with towel
      or box while heading straight to the vet.
     <br/><br/>
      Breathing difficulty: if the item ingested can be seen and dislodged, do
      so. If it’s not visible, head straight to your vet immediately.
      <br/><br/>
      Allergies and other medical conditions are best treated with vets. If you
      are a pet-sitter, be sure to have the owner’s contact handy. They might
      know what to do and what to give it to remedy the situation incase of
      allergies.

    <p>
      It's widespread for pets such as cats and dogs to be exposed to hazardous
      substances in the environment. The USA, the country with the largest
      companion animal population in the world (72 million pet dogs), recorded
      over two hundred thousand cases of dog poisoning in 2019 alone. 
      <br/><br/>
      Dogs are notoriously curious explorers, and this makes them vulnerable to contact
      with toxic substances. Dogs could be poisoned through contact with,
      ingestion, or inhalation of hazardous materials. 
      <br/><br/>
      Typically, the amount of time poison stays in a dog's system depends on factors such
      as the type and amount of poison they've encountered, the treatment methods, and how
      quickly these treatments are administered. 
      <br/><br/>
      Most people assume "poison" refers to just chemical substances, but medication and 
      food which are necessary for humans may be harmful to dogs. Ingested poisons include
      chocolate, human medicines, grapes, raisins, pesticides, poisoned rodents,
      or cleaning substances; inhaled toxins include insecticides, carbon
      monoxide and examples of contact poison are tar, paint, and arsenic.
